# Software Debouncing

## Purpose and Theory
The purpose of this lab is to eliminate the button bounce.  The bouncing of a button occurs because the contacts are made of springy metals.  When pressing the button it may look as if the button was pressed multiple times.

## Board Features
All boards function the same way.  When a button is pressed on the board the Red LED will turn on/off.

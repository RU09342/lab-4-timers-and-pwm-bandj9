# Software Debouncing

## Project Description
The purpose of this lab is to eliminate the button bounce.  The bouncing of a button occurs because the contacts are made of springy metals.  When pressing the button it may look as if the button was pressed multiple times. All boards function the same way.  When a button is pressed on the board the Red LED will turn on/off.
